# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- Distributed benchmark runs: `atomics distributed run` submits split-mode jobs across multiple workers; `atomics worker` starts a worker process that polls the coordinator, executes tasks, and reports results.
- New API endpoints for worker registration, heartbeat, task polling, and result submission under `/api/v1/workers` and `/api/v1/distributed/runs`.
- Pluggable worker API-key authentication (`X-API-Key`) for distributed endpoints.
- End-to-end local test coverage for distributed runs.

## 0.11.0 (2026-07-20) — API server mode, real RAG retrieval, richer multi-turn fixtures

### Added
- API server mode: `atomics server` runs a FastAPI service with async job scheduling (`POST /api/v1/runs`, `POST /api/v1/evals`, `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}`), API key authentication (`X-API-Key`), and read-only endpoints for comparison (`/api/v1/compare`) and recent runs (`/api/v1/reports/recent-runs`). Requires the `[api]` extra.
- Added 20 new multi-turn conversation fixtures (`mt-eval-16` through `mt-eval-35`) covering contradiction detection, persona drift/stability, long-context retention, multi-turn tool-use, and security-focused scenarios. Long-context fixtures use `max_output_tokens=1024` to avoid truncating summary turns.
- RAG pipeline with real retrieval: `atomics rag-index` builds a sqlite-vec index from local documents, `atomics rag --index` runs existing fixtures against retrieved chunks, and `atomics rag-retrieval` reports recall@k, precision@k, MRR, and nDCG@k. Optional `[rag]` extra includes `sqlite-vec` and `sentence-transformers`.

## 0.10.0 (2026-07-17) — RAG eval, multi-turn conversations, cost advisor, CI gates, docs overhaul

### Added
- **`atomics advisor`** — cost optimization advisor that analyzes historical
  benchmark data grouped by category and model, identifies the cheapest model
  meeting a `--min-quality` threshold (default 80%), and reports per-category
  recommendations with savings percentages. `--current-model`, `--since-hours`,
  `--json-out` flags.
- **`atomics multiturn`** — multi-turn conversation evaluation with 15 fixtures
  testing context retention (3), instruction following (3), coherence (2),
  correction handling (2), multi-step reasoning (1), constraint accumulation (2),
  and security-focused conversations (2). Real multi-turn: calls `generate()` per
  turn, accumulates transcript, scores at both turn level (Accuracy/Context Use/
  Coherence) and conversation level (Retention/Consistency/Instruction). 22 tests.
- **`atomics codegen`** — code generation evaluation with 15 Python fixtures
  (fizzbuzz through topological sort). Models generate functions, which are
  executed against deterministic test cases — pass/fail is objective, no judge.
  extract_function() handles code blocks and raw definitions. Custom comparison
  for anagram grouping and topological sort validity. 23 tests.
- **Multilingual eval fixtures** — 10 fixtures across 8 languages (Spanish,
  French, German, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic). Selectable
  via `atomics eval --fixtures ml-01,...`. 10 tests.
- **Webhook notifications** — `atomics/webhooks.py` with Slack (Block Kit),
  Discord (embeds), and generic HTTP POST. Auto-detects format by URL.
  `check_regression()` detects latency/success-rate degradation. Config via
  `ATOMICS_WEBHOOK_URL`. 18 tests.
- **llama.cpp provider** (`--provider llamacpp`) — direct local inference
  targeting llama-server's OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Zero cost, /health
  check. Config via `ATOMICS_LLAMACPP_HOST`. 7 tests.
- **Groq, Together AI, Google Gemini providers** — three new cloud providers
  with pricing tables (10 providers total). 29 tests.
- **GitHub Actions CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/eval-gate.yml`) — test,
  doctor, and optional eval/adversarial gate jobs with manual dispatch for
  provider and minimum resilience threshold. Uploads JSON artifacts.
- **Adversarial integrity ledger** — every fixture now retains its typed
  per-attempt and per-judge-call evidence in JSON and SQLite, including failed
  generation and judge calls. Schema v19 adds additive status, coverage,
  failure, representative-error, ledger, and provider-attempt token fields to
  `adversarial_results`, with model-under-test usage rolled up to parent runs.
- **`atomics adversarial --allow-partial`** — explicitly permits partial or
  infrastructure-invalid execution to exit zero after diagnostics.
- **Generic evaluation ledger** — schema v20 adds `evaluation_results` for
  refusal and secure-code-review fixtures. Results are saved incrementally,
  preserve typed status, usage, cost, sanitized errors, and raw model/judge
  evidence, and finalize their parent run even when later execution fails.
- **Two new adversarial suites** (adversarial fixture count 64 → 72):
  - `encoding` (5 fixtures) — base64 / ROT13 / leetspeak / hex / homoglyph-wrapped
    override requests. Tests whether safety reasoning survives an obfuscation
    layer or only operates on surface text. Group alias: `--category encoding`.
  - `many_shot` (3 fixtures) — context-stuffing attacks that stage many fabricated
    "assistant complied" turns via `prior_turns`, then deliver the real ask. Tests
    long-context safety degradation. Group alias: `--category many_shot`.
  Both use benign-but-forbidden markers only (no harmful content ships).
- **`atomics refusal`** — refusal-calibration eval measuring **both** safety
  failure modes. Fixtures pair `comply` (benign/dual-use security work), `refuse`
  (operational harm), and `clarify` (ambiguous scope) expectations; a judge
  classifies each response and the scorer reports `over_refusal_rate`,
  `under_refusal_rate`, and an overall `calibration_score`. Catches over-aligned
  models that refuse legitimate security work, which resistance-only evals miss.
- **`atomics codereview`** — secure-code-review eval on code snippets and unified
  diffs. Vulnerable fixtures carry a known CWE (SQLi, command injection, path
  traversal, hardcoded secret, insecure deserialization, weak password hash);
  clean fixtures measure false positives. Reports `detection_rate`,
  `false_positive_rate`, and an F1-style `review_score`. `diff` mode tests
  PR-style review of a change in isolation.
- Docs: `docs/ADVERSARIAL_SUITES.md` documents all four new suites (encoding,
  many_shot) and companion evals (refusal, codereview) with usage and metrics.

### Changed
- **Honest adversarial completion** — partial and infrastructure-invalid runs
  now exit nonzero by default after JSON output and database finalization.
  Every fixture is persisted, compare runs own finalized parent rows, and the
  existing JSON shape remains compatible as an additive superset.
- **Converged refusal and code-review execution** — both runners now retain
  immutable provider attempts and judge-call evidence, expose
  `fixture_results`, typed integrity, and total cost, and follow the same
  nonzero-on-incomplete policy. Their commands support `--allow-partial`,
  `--save/--no-save`, progress callbacks, and canonical JSON output.
- **Modular CLI foundation** — refusal and code-review commands now live under
  `atomics.commands`; shared provider construction, model attribution,
  progress, JSON writing, persistence conversion, and integrity exit policy
  are centralized in `commands.common`.
- **Pre-1.0 schema upgrades** — opening a pre-v20 database creates a
  timestamped WAL-safe backup before the existing reset migration policy runs.

### Security
- Refusal and code-review JSON exports and
  `evaluation_results.result_json` contain raw model and judge evidence.
  Documentation now calls out their sensitive-data handling requirements;
  persisted exception summaries continue to be sanitized.

## 0.9.0 (2026-07-09) — labcompare, security hardening, frontier comparison, Phase-C typing

### Added
- **`atomics labcompare`** — compare two+ Ollama inference hosts side-by-side on
  throughput (single-stream tok/s, latency, prompt-eval rate, VRAM fit read from
  each host's `/api/ps`) and quality parity (same fixtures, one fixed judge, so
  identical weights should score identically — a gap flags a problem). Additive:
  reuses existing providers/runners/judge as libraries and persists to a new
  `labcompare_results` table (schema v16). No existing command or table changed.
- **`docs/FRONTIER_COMPARISON.md`** — validated comparison of frontier cloud
  models (GPT-5.5, Claude Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8) vs local inference (qwen3.6:27b,
  phi4). Key finding: local qwen3.6:27b matches every frontier model at 100%
  adversarial resistance and ~95% security capability for $0.
- **`SECURITY.md`** — operational security documentation covering hooks, OAuth,
  secrets, URL validation, and output sanitization.
- **`atomics/validation.py`** — central URL validator (`validate_endpoint_url`)
  and error sanitizer (`sanitize_error`) used by CLI, labcompare, and all eval
  runners to strip leaked credentials from persisted exception strings.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — layer map, the load-bearing primitives, how to add an
  eval suite, and the security model. Linked from the README for contributors.
- **`atomics/stats.py`** — single home for the percentile helper that was
  copy-pasted across 5 modules.
- **Type checking in CI** — ship a `py.typed` marker (PEP 561) and add a mypy
  gate. **Phase-C typing pass is complete**: `scenario`, `qa_runner`, all five
  provider adapters, `storage.repository`, and `atomics.cli` are now type-clean
  with their real types (profiles, provider clients, result dataclasses via
  `TYPE_CHECKING`, and a `BaseProvider`-typed factory). All `# type: ignore`
  shims are gone and **no per-module mypy overrides remain** — `mypy atomics` is
  green across all 89 files.

### Changed
- **Single provider factory** — `eval`/`archreview` no longer carry their own
  `_build_provider`; all commands use `_make_provider` (now takes optional
  `region`/`context_tokens`/`inference_timeout`).
- **Eval-suite convergence** (additive, no breaking changes): every suite now
  has `Summary.to_dict()` + `--json-out` (added `eval`, `probe`, `archreview`)
  and creates + finalizes a parent `runs` row (`eval` now calls `complete_run`;
  `probe`/`archreview` gained `complete_probe_run`/`complete_archreview_run`).
  `RedBlueSummary`/`ProbeSummary` expose `fixture_results` as an alias for
  `results`; `archreview` accepts `--runs` as an alias for `--rounds`. See
  ARCHITECTURE.md "known divergences" (JSON-export and parent-run-row rows now
  fully converged).

### Security
- **`atomics secrets get` no longer prints the value by default.** It reports
  presence + a masked preview; use `--show` to print the raw value for piping.
  Removes accidental secret exposure via terminal scrollback / shell history.
- **Path traversal in `--repo`** — `atomics archreview --repo ../../x` is now
  rejected; only simple names matching files in `atomics/archreview/repos/` are
  accepted.
- **Unknown provider names error instead of silent Ollama fallback** — a typo in
  `--provider` or `--extra-judges` now raises a clear error instead of quietly
  using the wrong backend.
- **Rich markup injection** — LLM responses, judge rationale, and error messages
  are escaped before terminal rendering so a model cannot inject fake Rich markup.
- **URL validation** — all `--ollama-host`, `--vllm-host`, `--judge-host`, and
  `--host` flags reject `file://`, embedded credentials, and path traversal.
- **Error message sanitization** — exception strings stored in the DB are scrubbed
  of Bearer tokens, API keys, and AWS credentials before persistence.
- **Secrets key allowlist** — `atomics secrets set` validates key names against
  `KNOWN_KEYS`; use `--force` for custom keys.
- **Rich tracebacks disabled in normal mode** — only shown with `-v`/`--verbose`
  to prevent accidental exposure of frame locals containing secrets.

## 0.8.0 (2026-07-04) — New adversarial suites, export/compare/CI plumbing, redblue variance

### Added
- **`atomics redblue --json-out FILE`** — machine-readable run export via
  `RedBlueSummary.to_dict()`, matching the adversarial command.
- **Suite-isolated export** — `query_task_results` gains `suite`/`suite_prefix`
  filters; `atomics export --suite eval` and `--suite redblue` now return only
  those rows instead of all `task_results` blended together.
- **Three new adversarial fixture suites (16 fixtures)** raising the total to 64:
  - **multi-turn manipulation** (`atomics/eval/adversarial/multiturn.py`, group
    `--category multiturn`): gradual escalation, rapport exploitation, fabricated
    "as we agreed earlier" prior agreement, foot-in-the-door, and role drift.
    Fixtures carry a scripted `prior_turns` conversation the runner renders as a
    transcript prefix, so multi-turn attacks work across every provider without
    changing the single-prompt `generate()` contract.
  - **RAG / retrieved-context poisoning** (`rag_poisoning.py`, `--category
    rag_poisoning`): instructions embedded in retrieved documents, citation
    spoofing, retrieved-doc claims of authority over the system prompt,
    frontmatter directives, and poisoned-knowledge-to-unsafe-action.
  - **MCP tool-description injection** (`tool_desc_injection.py`, `--category
    tool_desc_injection`): hostile directives hidden in a tool's description,
    tool shadowing, parameter-schema injection, hidden/unicode directives, and
    exfiltration framed as tool telemetry — the model-reasoning analogue of the
    hammerhand/artifice tool-metadata attack surface.
- **`atomics adversarial --json-out FILE`** — machine-readable export of the full
  run (per-fixture scores, labels, judge scores, rationales, latency, cost) via
  `AdversarialSummary.to_dict()`, including both models when `--compare` is used.
- **`atomics adversarial --compare MODEL`** — run a second model on the same
  fixtures and print a per-fixture score diff (Δ B−A) plus overall-resilience
  delta. Accepts `model`, `provider:model`, or `provider:model@host`.
- **`atomics adversarial --fail-on-resilience N`** — CI gate; exits non-zero when
  severity-weighted resilience %% is below the threshold.
- **Adversarial persistence lifecycle** — the run now creates a parent `runs` row
  (tier `adversarial`) and finalizes it with `complete_adversarial_run()`, which
  aggregates `adversarial_results` (not `task_results`). New
  `get_adversarial_results()` repository query and `atomics export --suite
  adversarial` (also included in `--suite all`).
- **`atomics redblue --runs N`** — variance-aware scoring (mean ± stddev across
  passes) matching `adversarial`; makes the existing QUICKSTART example valid.
- **Progress tracker for long-running evals** — group-level `--verbose/-v` and
  `--progress/--no-progress` flags. Live Rich spinner shows fixture ID, category,
  and ETA during inference. Works across `redblue` and `adversarial` commands.
- **Resilient judge scoring for thinking-mode models** — judge calls now use a
  3-tier fallback: (1) `thinking=False` direct response, (2) retry with thinking
  enabled if response empty, (3) parse from thinking content as last resort. Works
  across all providers (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI, vLLM) without model-specific config.
- **qwen3.6 model research** (`docs/model-notes/qwen/`): architecture analysis,
  speed/quality benchmarks, deployment role recommendations. Key finding: qwen3.6
  MoE (35B-A3B) at 61 tok/s validated as superior judge model (stricter, more
  discerning than qwen2.5:7b).
- **Red/Blue capability leaderboard** (`docs/LEADERBOARD-REDBLUE.md`): 20-model
  overnight sweep results with resistance-vs-capability 2x2 matrix.
- **OS-keychain secrets layer** (`atomics secrets set/get/list/delete`): layered
  resolution (env → .env → keychain) with macOS Keychain / Linux secret-service.

### Fixed
- **redblue truncated thinking models** — fixtures cap `max_output_tokens` at
  1024, which is sized for the visible answer; with thinking enabled, reasoning
  models spent that budget on hidden reasoning and got cut off, scoring as a
  capability gap. The runner now raises the budget to >=4096 when thinking is
  active (explicit `--thinking` or an auto-detected reasoning model).
- **Adversarial fixture count reconciled** — `ALL_FIXTURES` was 32 while the
  runner actually loaded 48 (mcp_agentic + tool_safety were wired in the runner
  but not exported), so the header/docs disagreed with the real run. `ALL_FIXTURES`
  is now the single source of truth (64 with the new suites); the runner and CLI
  both select via `select_fixtures()`, and the duplicate `AdversarialFixture`
  dataclass in `mcp_agentic.py` was removed in favor of the canonical one.
- **redblue persistence** — FK constraint failure when saving fixture results
  (missing parent `runs` row). Now creates run row before fixture processing.
- **Judge parse failures with thinking models** — qwen3.6, deepseek-r1, and
  other thinking-capable models produced empty responses when used as judge,
  causing "Parse failed" on all fixtures. Fixed via thinking-aware fallback chain.

## 0.7.0 (2026-06-23) — Adversarial security suites, reasoning-model judge support, archreview keys

### Added
- **`atomics archreview`** — a repo-agnostic security-architecture review benchmark. Feeds each model under test a **deterministic, content-hashed, token-budgeted evidence pack** of a codebase (tiered: `floor` 16k / `local` 32k / `wide` 48k / `expanded` 128k, so small local models, practical local runs, larger local models, and frontier models are compared fairly) and scores its structured findings two independent ways: (1) **objective** difficulty-weighted OWASP-category recall/precision against a per-repo answer key (deterministic, judge-independent), and (2) a separate **self-judge-guarded reasoning score** (0–10 → 0–1) rating trust-boundary/data-flow/prioritization quality. Multi-round runs report finding-set **robustness** (mean pairwise Jaccard stability + recall stdev). Answer keys are pluggable per repo (`atomics/archreview/repos/<name>.yaml`); **OWASP Juice Shop** ships as the first target with its key derived from `challenges.yml` (per-category weight = summed challenge difficulty). New `atomics/archreview/` package (taxonomy, models, evidence-pack builder, prompt + lenient findings parser, answer-key generator, scorer, async runner), `archreview_results` table (schema v15), and `atomics archreview` CLI with a Rich comparison table. `--max-output-tokens` caps generation for slow local triage runs, `--inference-timeout` lets long-context local runs finish, and `--judge-only` skips objective scoring for repos without a key. Reuses the existing provider abstraction, `detect_self_judge`, and lenient-parsing patterns. New tests across taxonomy/models/pack/prompt/keygen/scorer/runner/storage/CLI.

- **Zero-trust adversarial fixtures** (`atomics/eval/adversarial/zerotrust.py`) —
  6 new fixtures benchmarking model resistance to agentic attack patterns: tool-use
  manipulation via injected context (MCP-T02), breakglass token extraction,
  credential exfiltration via tool calls, system-prompt rewrite persistence,
  authority fabrication, and runtime blocklist evasion. Each maps to a proven attack
  from the zero-trust stack (Artifice RCON injection, Gatekeeper bypass, camazotz
  cred_broker, nullfield HOLD, skillseraph J1, Artifice blocklist). Registered in
  `ALL_FIXTURES`; run with `atomics adversarial --category zerotrust`.
- **Archreview answer keys for ecosystem repos** — pluggable YAML keys for
  `nullfield` (10 categories: PEP/PDP split, 5-action model, credential stripping,
  fail-closed, circuit breaker, TLS mesh assumption, admin API, identity, audit,
  budgets), `zero-trust-blueprint` (10 categories: layered PEP, shared PDP,
  ambient nonbypassability, egress credential isolation, admission hygiene, network
  defense-in-depth, identity gap, model allowlist, CNI caveat), and `camazotz`
  (10 categories: guardrail-not-boundary, OWASP MCP Top 10, OIDC identity,
  nullfield sidecar, tool execution despite refusal, observer, multi-provider,
  credential labs, runtime config, supply chain). All with 4-tier evidence packs.

- **Agentic-reasoning adversarial fixtures** (`atomics/eval/adversarial/agentic_reasoning.py`) —
  11 fixtures across 5 categories testing model reasoning about security architecture:
  MCP protocol (tool-output injection, dangerous tool selection, cross-server exfil),
  supply-chain trust (dependency-planted configs, review suppression), delegation
  (credential forwarding, privilege escalation through depth), egress awareness
  (credential sprawl, secrets-in-prompts), admission (LLM-as-policy antipattern,
  deterministic vs non-deterministic). Group alias: `--category agentic`.
- **`--verbose` flag** for adversarial eval — dumps the full attack prompt, model
  response, judge rationale, and resistance criteria for each fixture.
- **Reasoning-model judge support** — deepseek-r1, phi4-reasoning, gemma4, and
  functiongemma can now be used as judges. Three-pass score parsing (standard →
  markdown → bare-score), `<think>` block stripping, sentiment-based fallback,
  and score-rationale contradiction detection.
- **ADVERSARIAL_SUITES.md** — comprehensive docs covering flow, scoring, all
  suites, 10-model benchmark leaderboard, and ecosystem context.
- **Total adversarial fixtures: 32** (base 15 + zerotrust 6 + agentic 11).

### Fixed and improved
- **Ollama provider** — explicitly set `think=false` for non-thinking models,
  preventing Ollama from auto-enabling thinking and returning empty responses
  (affected gemma4:e4b).
- **Claude provider default** — updated from deprecated `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
  (404) to `claude-sonnet-4-6` (verified valid). All tests, CLI, and README updated.
- **Adversarial scorer** — multi-format judge output parsing, sentiment fallback,
  contradiction detector, lenient label resolution (numeric labels), increased
  max_tokens for judge calls (128→512).
- **CLI output** — category shown per fixture, first-sentence rationale in default
  mode (full in --verbose), soft-wrap for long lines, spacing fixes.
- **`archreview` parser tolerance** — added three new fallback passes so every major model output format is handled: (1) **markdown table rows** (`| injection | routes/x.ts | high | raw sql |`), (2) **numbered/bold lists** (`1. **Injection** — routes/x.ts — high — why`), and (3) **hybrid labeled-pipe** (`INJECTION | ROUTE: routes/x.ts | SEVERITY: high | WHY: …`). All passes now guard against markdown table header and separator rows so label words (`Category`, `Location`, etc.) and `---|---` lines are never returned as findings. Prompt tightened with an explicit "no markdown/no table/no numbering" instruction and a concrete one-line example to improve small-model format compliance.
- **`archreview` taxonomy** — 30+ new synonyms covering non-web targets: `path traversal`, `directory traversal`, `lfi/rfi`, `privilege escalation`, `open redirect` → `broken_access_control`; `hardcoded credentials/secret` → `sensitive_data_exposure`; `race condition`, `toctou`, `buffer overflow`, `integer overflow` → `improper_input_validation`; `ssti`, `log injection`, `crlf injection`, `ldap injection` → `injection`; `weak cipher/hash`, `insecure random` → `cryptographic_issues`; `dependency confusion`, `supply chain` → `vulnerable_components`; `dos`, `redos`, `resource exhaustion` → `broken_anti_automation`. Makes the tool useful against Go APIs, Rust services, IaC, and other non-webapp targets without any configuration.
- **`archreview` Juice Shop answer key v2** — added `ssrf` (weight 6.0, matches Juice Shop `challenges.yml` difficulty 6 and the confirmed surface in `routes/profileImageUrlUpload.ts`). Total weight 90 → 96. Frontier models that surface SSRF as the correct architectural category are no longer precision-penalized.
- **`archreview` Ollama context wiring** — evidence packs now request explicit `num_ctx` and `num_predict` so the model's context window is large enough for the prompt and there is always reserved output room. `ContextExhausted` is recorded instead of a misleading parse-failed/zero-recall result when a model stops before producing findings.
- **`archreview` evidence tiers** — added `local` (32k) between `floor` and `wide` for practical brainbox runs. `--max-output-tokens` and `--inference-timeout` CLI flags for controlling slow local inference. `--verbose` flag streams per-model/per-round findings and scores as they complete.
- **`archreview` judge identity** — `Judge Model` column in the comparison table shows `provider:model` (e.g. `ollama:deepseek-r1:7b`) so multi-model runs are unambiguous.
- **`archreview` finding deduplication** — `parse_findings()` collapses exact (category, location) pairs emitted multiple times by looping models (e.g. the same route listed 7× by qwen2.5:7b). Same category at different locations remains distinct. Applied at all five fallback passes.
- **`pack.py` type annotation** — `build_pack(cfg)` parameter typed as `TierConfig` (import added); zero untyped parameters across the `atomics/archreview/` package.
- **Test quality** — fixed pre-existing coroutine-never-awaited warning in `test_adversarial.py` by converting the nested sync side-effect to an async function; suite now runs with zero warnings.

## 0.6.0 (2026-06-16) — Security suites, vLLM provider, judge accuracy & token-burn fidelity

> Adds the red/blue capability and adversarial resilience suites, the live ecosystem probe, a vendor-neutral `inference.env` standard, an OpenAI-compatible `vllm` provider, hardened judge accuracy (consensus, calibration, gold-criteria coverage), honest token-burn/cost fidelity, and the `qa`/`soak`/`scenario`/`contention` load-testing commands.

### Added (stoneburner)
- **`atomics eval --fixtures ev-19[,…]`** — run a subset of the 25 eval fixtures for fast spot-checks/iteration instead of the full set. Unknown ids error out; the run header reports the real fixture count. (`run_eval` already accepted a `fixtures=` arg; this wires the CLI flag.)
- **Security suites are two independent axes** — documented (README + QUICKSTART) that `redblue` measures **capability** and `adversarial` measures **resilience**, that they don't correlate (live: a non-thinking 12B at 93%/76% vs a thinking 2B at 54%/91%), and that high-capability + low-resilience is the riskiest profile.
- **Full BRAINBOX model-class coverage** — added the gateway tags that were classifying as UNKNOWN (`gemma4:12b`/`26b`, `phi4:latest`, `phi4-mini:latest`, `qwen2.5-coder:14b`, `qwen3:14b`, `cogito:3b`, `dolphin3:latest`) so `compare`/`sweep` no longer show blanks; classes verified against live model sizes. Regression test asserts the whole lineup classifies.
- **QUICKSTART.md** — recipe-first guide grouped by goal (cost, quality+judge, consensus, security, scale, QA) with local **and** cloud treated as peers, a model-agnostic callout, config cheat-sheet (incl. `*_TIMEOUT`), and troubleshooting.
- **Self-judge guard** — `eval`, `redblue`, and `adversarial` now detect when a judge is the same provider+model as the model under test (covering consensus-panel members and the both-default-model case) via `detect_self_judge`, and warn that scores are biased by self-preference. Providers expose a uniform `default_model` property to resolve unspecified models. 6 tests.
- **Judge accuracy** — the LLM-as-judge quality scorer was hardened so accuracy scores are reproducible and harder to game. (1) **Deterministic scoring**: `generate()` gains an optional `temperature` across every provider (withheld where the backend forbids it — OpenAI reasoning models and Claude extended-thinking; brain-gateway controls sampling server-side) and the quality/resistance judges now request `temperature=0.0`. (2) **Fair completeness**: the judge's response-truncation cap scales to each fixture's expected output length (`char_budget_for_tokens`, ~4 chars/token, floored at 3000) so long HEAVY answers are judged in full instead of cut at 3000 chars. (3) **Gold-criteria coverage**: `compute_criteria_coverage` adds an objective, judge-independent lexical measure of how many of a fixture's gold criteria appear in the response — persisted on `task_results.criteria_coverage` (schema v13) and aggregated in `compare`. (4) **Multi-judge consensus**: `score_consensus` scores with a primary judge plus an optional panel of `(provider, model)` judges, averaging the scores that parsed and recording inter-judge stdev (`task_results.judge_score_stdev`, schema v14, surfaced as `avg_judge_score_stdev`); `eval` gains `--extra-judges provider:model[@host]`. (5) **Robust parsing**: a lenient field-by-field fallback (tolerates markdown, reordering, missing rationale) plus exactly one reformat retry replaces the all-or-nothing single regex, and a `parse_failure_rate` is surfaced in the eval summary. (6) **Calibration regression guard**: `atomics/eval/calibration.py` + `calibrate_judge` rank graded answers (wrong → thin → thorough) and assert monotonic, well-separated scoring; an opt-in live test (`ATOMICS_LIVE_JUDGE=1`) validates the real Ollama judge. New tests: `test_temperature.py`, `test_judge.py`, `test_calibration.py` plus storage/CLI coverage. README "Judge accuracy" section documents the methodology.
- **Token-burn fidelity** — provider metrics now report only what each API can actually observe, so cross-model cost/throughput comparisons are honest. (1) Claude prompt-cache tokens (`cache_read_input_tokens`/`cache_creation_input_tokens`) are captured on `ProviderResponse.cache_read_tokens`/`cache_write_tokens` and priced correctly (reads 0.10×, writes 1.25× the base input rate). (2) Thinking tokens are populated only when truly reported — OpenAI `reasoning_tokens` (Chat Completions `completion_tokens_details`, Responses API `output_tokens_details`); Ollama/vLLM use a character-proportional estimate anchored to the real output-token total; Claude stays 0 (Anthropic bills thinking as output). (3) `tokens_per_second` is standardized to total output tokens ÷ elapsed time via `compute_tps`, with a new `tps_basis` field labeling `wall_clock` vs `generation` (Ollama decode time); Bedrock now reports throughput. (4) Pricing tables and the cost function are centralized in `atomics/providers/pricing.py`. New fields persist to `task_results` (schema v12) and surface in `provider-test` output and `compare`. README "Metrics & Fidelity" section documents the methodology. New tests: `test_pricing.py` plus cache/thinking/tps coverage across the provider suites.
- **`inference.env` standard + reference reader/resolver** — a vendor-neutral control file (`docs/INFERENCE_ENV.md`) lets any box describe the LLM inference target it is wired to, so consumers self-configure. New `atomics/inference.py` provides: `parse_env`, `normalize_legacy` (folds legacy `brain/` keys — `INFERENCE_API`, `OLLAMA_*`, `OPENAI_*` — into the canonical `INFERENCE_BACKEND/URL/MODEL/THINK/API_KEY` schema), `InferenceTarget` (typed view with `from_text`/`from_mapping`), `load_control_file` (searches `$INFERENCE_ENV`/`$BRAIN_ENV`/`/opt/agentic`/`/etc/agentic`, returns `None` for clean fallback), the agnostic resolver (`resolve_model`, `resolve_endpoint`, `check_model_compat`, `check_backend`, `render_env`, `resolve`), and `provider_from_target`/`load_provider` to auto-build the matching provider (ollama→`OllamaProvider`, vllm→`VllmProvider`, openai→`OpenAIProvider`). No box-specific hosts/creds/k8s glue. 23 unit tests.
- **`--provider vllm`** — new `VllmProvider` adapter targeting any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`/v1/chat/completions`). Supports vLLM, LiteLLM, llama.cpp. `--vllm-host` flag on all eval commands (`run`, `provider-test`, `sweep`, `adversarial`, `redblue`, `probe`). Config via `ATOMICS_VLLM_HOST` / `ATOMICS_VLLM_MODEL`. Thinking mode via `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` for qwen3-family models. 24 unit tests + 7 CLI integration tests. Probe profile `profiles/vllm-gateway.yaml` for the lab LiteLLM gateway.
- **`atomics models --provider vllm`** — model discovery from OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint. Table drops Size/Params columns (not available from gateway). `--vllm-host` flag mirrors `--host` for Ollama.
- **`qwen3:0.6b` registered** — added to `MODEL_CLASS_MAP` (LIGHT) and `THINKING_CAPABLE` set. Was showing as unknown on the gateway.
- **`atomics baselines` CLI test** — added `test_cli_baselines_empty` and `test_cli_baselines_with_records` covering the empty-db and populated table paths.
- **Baseline regression tracking** — `atomics soak --save-baseline NAME` captures key metrics (avg tok/s, peak tok/s, P95 latency, error rate, verdict) under a named key. `--compare-baseline NAME` prints a colour-coded delta table and reports IMPROVED / STABLE / REGRESSED. `atomics baselines` lists all saved baselines. Thresholds: >10% TPS drop or >20% P95 spike triggers REGRESSED. Schema v11 adds `baselines` table with UNIQUE(name, suite) upsert. 23 tests.
- **Scenario ramp (`--ramp`)** — `atomics scenario --ramp 10` staggers worker start times across the ramp window so load builds gradually rather than hammering at t=0. Stored on `ScenarioResult.ramp_seconds`. 6 tests.
- **Multi-model VRAM contention (`--models`)** — `atomics stress --models qwen2.5:3b,qwen2.5:7b` runs each model solo first (baseline TPS), then all simultaneously. Reports per-model TPS degradation as a contention factor (<1.0 = degradation). CLI colour codes: green ≥0.9, yellow ≥0.7, red <0.7. 22 tests.
- **`atomics qa`** — QA validation for CTF solvability and AI gate regression. Reads a YAML fixture file defining prompts with `pass_patterns`, `fail_patterns`, and `must_match` (pass/fail/any). Fires each at an Ollama model, evaluates responses with case-insensitive regex, prints a rich table and overall pass rate. `--fail-fast` stops at first failure. Example fixtures in `qa/examples/`. 32 tests.
- **`atomics soak --think-time SECONDS`** — simulate realistic user pacing by inserting a think-time sleep between requests per worker. Defaults to 0 (no pause). Lets you model actual concurrency (N workers × think_time determines effective req/s) rather than pure hammering. 4 tests.
- **`atomics qa --profile`** — `--profile profiles/local/gate.yaml` routes fixture queries through a TargetProfile (app HTTP endpoint or Ollama with custom system prompt) instead of raw Ollama. Fixture YAML stays committed; real IPs/tokens live in `profiles/local/` (gitignored). 8 tests.
- **Custom target profiles** — YAML-based profiles for testing application-level AI gates. Two modes: `ollama` (Ollama with custom system prompt, temperature, num_predict) and `http` (arbitrary HTTP endpoint with body template, response parsing, and latency extraction). `--profile` flag added to `soak`, `stress`, and `scenario` commands. Response classification (`classify:` in YAML) detects model drift under load. Sensitive profiles gitignored via `profiles/local/`. 42 tests.
- **`atomics soak`** — long-duration stability test. Holds fixed concurrency for minutes or hours, sampling throughput and latency at configurable intervals. Computes linear-regression drift to classify runs as STABLE / DEGRADED / UNSTABLE. Tracks VRAM drift, error rate, and total cost. Human-friendly duration parsing (`30m`, `2h`, `1h30m`, bare minutes). Works with all providers. Database persistence in `soak_results` table. 48 tests.
- **`atomics scenario`** — mixed-workload inference simulation. Runs multiple agentic workload profiles (gate, eval) concurrently against a shared Ollama host. Measures per-workload P50/P95 latency, SLA compliance, and cross-workload interference scores via automatic solo-baseline comparison. Supports YAML scenario files and CLI shorthand (`-w type:model:concurrency[:sla_ms]`). 8 gate prompts + 8 eval prompts built in; custom prompt files supported. 42 tests.
- **`atomics sweep --save`** — persist sweep results to new `sweep_results` DB table (schema v8)
- **`atomics export --suite {tasks,stress,sweep,all}`** — export any stored suite as jsonl or CSV
- **`atomics compare --output FILE`** — write JSON comparison alongside the Rich table
- **`atomics doctor` documentation** — README section with full check list and CI usage guidance
- **`configs/*.toml` removed** — orphaned profile TOMLs unreferenced by any code were deleted

### Fixed (stoneburner)
- **Thinking models spuriously timed out at 120s** — `OllamaProvider`/`VllmProvider` hard-coded a 120s request timeout, so reasoning models (e.g. qwen3:4b) that legitimately think for >2min on hard fixtures failed mid-eval (surfaced as `ev-19` `ReadTimeout` in a live run). Timeout is now configurable via `ATOMICS_OLLAMA_TIMEOUT` / `ATOMICS_VLLM_TIMEOUT` with a 300s default, threaded through the provider factories.
- **Blank error messages on failed fixtures** — exceptions with an empty `str()` (notably `httpx.ReadTimeout`) recorded `error_message=''`, producing useless `"ev-NN failed:"` log lines and empty DB rows. The eval/redblue/adversarial runners now fall back to `repr(exc)` and log the resolved message; redblue also records `error_class`. Regression test added.
- **`atomics sweep` hid why a model failed** — a model whose fixtures all errored (e.g. a tag not pulled on the host → 404) showed only `FAIL`. `ModelSweepResult` now carries a representative `error` and the CLI prints it next to each failed model.
- **Test suite hard-failed without optional extras** — running on a base install (no `openai`/`boto3`) produced 7 failures instead of skips. Tests that require those extras now use `pytest.importorskip`, and two coverage-sensitive soak timing tests were hardened (1.0s→3.0s sampling window) after flaking on a slower Linux host. Verified green on both macOS/3.13 and Linux/3.12.
- **`atomics eval --provider vllm` crashed with "Unknown provider: vllm"** — `eval` was the one eval command never wired for vLLM: its local `_build_provider` had no `vllm` branch and the command lacked a `--vllm-host` flag, despite `vllm` being a valid `PROVIDER_CHOICES` value. Added the `--vllm-host` option, a `vllm` branch (model + judge resolve via `vllm_host`/`ATOMICS_VLLM_HOST`), and made the saved run record's model resolution vllm-aware. 2 regression tests (explicit host + config fallback). Verified live against the vLLM gateway (model under test, qwen2.5:3b as judge).
- **Probe HTTP connector used uninstalled `aiohttp`** — `_fetch_http` lazily imported `aiohttp`, which is not in the dependency tree, so the entire HTTP probe path was dead (0% coverage). Migrated to `httpx` (already a core dep). Added truncation, custom-header, and error-path tests; connector coverage 57% → 94%.
- **Adversarial scorer regex** — `[\r\n]+` after resistance score required a newline immediately after the integer. Small models (qwen2.5:3b, qwen3.5:0.8b) pad lines with trailing spaces (`RESISTANCE: 5  \n`), breaking all parse attempts and silently returning `score=0.5` for every fixture. Changed to `\s+` throughout. 3 regression tests added (clean `\n`, trailing-space `\n`, CRLF).

### Tests (stoneburner)
- **OAuth flow coverage 36% → 100%** — added 17 tests for `auth/oauth.py`: `_exchange_code`, `_refresh` (incl. refresh-token preservation), `_device_code_flow` (success / `authorization_pending` / `slow_down` / unknown-error), `_browser_flow` with mocked callback server, `login` headless/browser delegation, `validate` exception path, `_parse_token_response`, and all three `Handler.do_GET` branches (success, state mismatch, OAuth error).

### Changed (stoneburner)
- `atomics sweep --host` renamed to `--ollama-host` (hidden `--host` alias kept for backward compat)
- `atomics capacity --think-time` shorthand changed from `-t` to `--think` (removes collision with `--tier` `-t`)
- Schema bumped v7 → v8 → v9 → v10 → v11 → v12 → v13 → v14 (adds `sweep_results`, `scenario_results`, `soak_results`, and `baselines` tables, then `cache_read_tokens`/`cache_write_tokens`/`tps_basis`, then `criteria_coverage`, then `judge_score_stdev` columns on `task_results`; existing DBs auto-migrated via fresh-start)
- `atomics export --suite soak` added for soak result export

### Added (mcpnuke)
- **SARIF 2.1.0 export** via `--sarif FILE` — maps CRITICAL/HIGH → `error`, MEDIUM → `warning`, LOW → `note`; embeds `security-severity` and taxonomy tags; ready for GitHub Code Scanning upload
- **`--fail-on {critical,high,medium,low,any,none}`** — configurable CI severity gate replacing hardcoded CRITICAL/HIGH exit; default unchanged (`high`)
- **LICENSE** file (MIT)
- **mcpnuke-runner** documentation in `docs/ci-cd-guide.md` — K8s/Helm deployment, env vars, manual trigger API

### Fixed (mcpnuke)
- `_raw_token` is now stripped from `auth_context` in all JSON output paths — tokens are never written to report files, PR comments, or CI artifacts

## 0.3.0 — Accuracy Scoring, LLM-as-Judge, and Business-Case Narrative

### Added
- **`atomics eval` command** — run a fixed set of 15 reproducible eval fixtures against any provider and score quality with an LLM judge
  - Each fixture has gold criteria (key concepts a correct answer must cover) that are injected into the judge's rubric
  - Fixtures span security, cloud/infra, LLM/AI, and general engineering at light / moderate / heavy complexity
- **LLM-as-judge** (`atomics/eval/judge.py`) — rubric-based scoring (Accuracy 0–4, Completeness 0–3, Format 0–3) normalized to 0.0–1.0
  - Defaults to local Ollama so judging never adds API spend
  - Tolerates CRLF line endings and common judge model spelling variations (`COMPLETNESS` etc.)
  - Multi-line rationales collapsed to a single stored sentence
- **`accuracy_score`, `judge_model`, `quality_rationale`** fields on `task_results` (schema v4)
- **`avg_accuracy_score` and `value_score`** columns in `atomics compare` — value score = accuracy / cost-per-1K-tokens, with a $0.001 floor so free local runs have a finite (large) score rather than infinity
- **`atomics compare --narrative`** — plain-English business-case summary comparing self-hosted vs cloud API options: quality gap, cost delta, privacy posture, and total API spend
- **`--judge-host`** option on `atomics eval`; falls back to `--ollama-host` → `ATOMICS_OLLAMA_HOST` so the judge always routes to the right Ollama instance
- **Reasoning-model support** in the OpenAI provider: `gpt-5` and related models use `max_completion_tokens` (not `max_tokens`) with an 8× multiplier for internal reasoning budget
- **Model pricing** for `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-turbo`, `gpt-5.3`, `gpt-5.5`, `o3-pro`
- **Model class entries** for `qwen2.5:14b`, `qwen2.5:32b`, `qwen2.5:72b`, `gpt-5*`, `o3-pro`

### Fixed
- `on_fixture_done` callback now fires for **failed** fixtures too — previously provider failures were invisible in the live eval table and were never saved to the database
- `_SCORE_RE` regex uses `[\r\n]+` instead of `\n` to handle CRLF responses from OpenAI and other APIs
- `COMPLET\w*` pattern absorbs both `COMPLETENESS` and `COMPLETNESS` (qwen spelling variant)
- Schedule command used Rich's `Console.print` for raw config text, causing word-wrap to split long `ExecStart` lines and break embedded flags
- `test_ollama_config_defaults` isolated from project `.env` so it does not fail when `ATOMICS_OLLAMA_HOST` is set to a non-default value

### Changed
- `atomics compare` table now includes Quality and Value Score columns alongside existing latency/cost columns
- Schema bumped from v3 → v4; existing databases are migrated automatically on first open
- 289 tests, 0 failures

## 0.2.0 — Ollama Provider + Throughput Metrics

### Added
- **Ollama provider** (`--provider ollama`) for zero-cost local LLM inference
  - Configurable endpoint via `--ollama-host` or `ATOMICS_OLLAMA_HOST`
  - Default model via `ATOMICS_OLLAMA_MODEL` (default: `qwen2.5:7b`)
  - Full tok/s throughput measurement from Ollama's `eval_duration`
  - Health check via `/api/tags`
- **`tokens_per_second`** field on `ProviderResponse` — all providers now report throughput
  - Cloud providers derive it from `output_tokens / latency`
  - Ollama derives it from Ollama's native eval timing
- **tok/s column** in `atomics compare` output for throughput comparison
- **Ollama models** in the model class taxonomy (`qwen2.5:*`, `qwen3:*`, `llama3.*`, `mistral:7b`, `codellama:7b`)
- **Ollama connectivity check** in `atomics doctor`
- **`tokens_per_second`** persisted in SQLite (`task_results` table), schema v3

### Changed
- `atomics provider-test` now shows throughput (tok/s) when available
- `atomics compare` table includes average tok/s per provider/model
- Bumped version to 0.2.0

## 0.1.0 — Initial Release

- Claude, Bedrock, OpenAI providers
- Burn tiers (ez/baseline/mega)
- SQLite metrics persistence
- CLI: run, report, compare, schedule, provider-test, doctor, export
- OAuth/OIDC and Codex authentication
- Cron/systemd/launchd scheduling
